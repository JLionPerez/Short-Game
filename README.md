Rock Paper Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors


How to play the game: click on main.exe or if you want download/clone the repo into your desktop and run using python



Dev Notes:
A short game of something because I keep abandoning my old games.
6/13 - made this into a rock paper scissors game, and first version is complete.
6/16 - updated the executable to include the "try again" function
